## Overview
This application utilizes Yahoo's Weather API in order to get weather information for specific locations. When a location has been retrieved through a search, it is saved to a locations list. All saved locations can be viewed in 'Recent Locations'.  Each location can also be removed from the list, and that removed location will no longer be present in your Recent Locations.

For each location, when you search for it using the search bar or select it from your saved locations - you will be able to view the current weather for that day as well as the forecast for the next 3 days. The 'Current' and 'Future' buttons will allow you to toggle back and forth between those two options.
