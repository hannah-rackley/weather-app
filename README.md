## Overview
This application utilizes Yahoo's Weather API in order to get weather information for specific locations. It will save those locations to an overall list that you will then be able to toggle through.  Each location can be removed from the list, and that location will no longer be stored.

For each location, when you search for it using the search bar or select it from your saved locations - you will be able to view the current weather for that day as well as the forecast for the next 3 days. The 'Current' and 'Future' buttons will allow you to toggle back and forth between those two options.
